                            <p> Hey guys, this sub is amazing. thanks for all the help i've found in searches. amp#x200B; I have a question though; one that I wasn't able to find a clear answer in search/faq: amp#x200B; I have a PSN PKG for a PS3 game. I want to play it but I don't want to take up room on my PS3 HDD so I'd like to play this game off my EXT HD. amp#x200B; Is there a way for me to convert my PKG to an ISO and play the game like my other PS3 backups? Can I do this with multiman. Hello everyone. amp#x200B; I've always downloaded the scene releases of PS4 games in ISO format and have always checked through the Redump.org (https://Redump.org) database. The ISO files always had the same hash cataloged in the Redump database. amp#x200B; However, now the scene only releases the games in PKG format. amp#x200B; I would like to know if it is possible to build an ISO file in Redump format from the PKGs released by the scene. amp#x200B; In the case of PS3, I rebui. Has anyone had any luck getting this to run as an ISO? I've tried using PSN Liberator about a couple of times now. Once with the game fix for it and once without. Both times, it loads just fine on the main XMB menu, I can see the picture pop up and the disc icon load just fine, but when I try and start it, both via Webman and Multiman, I just get the error code (80010007). Has anyone else tried this? 
Is there a way of converting a PS3 PKG game to ISO and if by doing it would the PSN version be converted to the disk one (except in those cases where the games don't have a disc version, of course)? It's because I don't find a certain version (european, instead of american) but I don't know if it wouldn't be bigger on space when comparing to the unwanted version which was already on disc version. amp#x200B; Should I use PS3 ISO Tools or PS3 ISO Rebuilder to convert the PS3 JB games Hello, previously I used a Slim with CFW and I could install PKGs from PSN for PSX and PS2 games, I want to know if I can use these PKGs on my new Super Slim The Old Slim broke so I'm getting used to using HAN instead I have a few ps4 iso backups from a while ago. How can I convert these to pkg, so I can instally on my PS4 4.05 Hen? Is it the same process as how it was in the PS3 age? Would I just be able to use the same tools for PS3 to convert. I'm wondering if this is possible. I'd like to just be able to get to all my games in one click instead of going through Webman or Multiman. I saw Lastgame Customizer but I don't think it works on 4.81.2 Rebug. Anyone done this before. I want to play P3Fes but the undub is PS2 iso only I tried aldos tools to convert the ISO to ENC.BIN then from that to PKG but the program crashes immediately. I swapped the P3Fes ENC.BIN from the USA PSN store PKG install with the PS2 ENC.BIN converted from the undub ISO but when loading the game on the PS3 I hit the black screen and it stays there. I figured its the EDAT or something but idk how to mess with that or if there is an easier way. I know I can just play the PS2 iso normally. 
WHAT IS HEN: HEN stands for Homebrew ENabler. it also consists of much more new functions relatively close to a CFW amp#x200B; HOW DOES IT WORK?: Install HAN Enabler. Copy PS3HEN.BIN, HENTAI.pkg and stackframe.bin(READ:rename) to /dev\_usb000 and run the HTML. Once done, go to Package manager and install the HENTAI.pkg and reboot console From now on to enable HEN simply use usb000 stackframe.bin and PS3HEN.BIN and run html.HEN ENABLED! amp#x200B; FEATURES OF V1.00: Managunz backup. I was wondering if it's possible to convert PS3 game backups on folder format (those stored in the GAMES folder) so that they show up in the XMB like they were legit PSN games. I think I have to convert them to .PKG first (it looks like I need the .RAP/.RIP files so that they can work and will I lose the DLC I had?) but can someone tell me if all the PS3 backups or at least many of them don't have problems after being converted and loaded (like lag, freezing, black screens, etc.) Hi, I have a super slim with hen, I want to find a way to play ps2 iso (and if I can ps1 too) on it, because the ps2 PKG games from the store Running HFW 4.84 and HAN 0.7; I found games ive converted from ISO to package myself play without the need of intializing han offline. These are the ones ive used CFW2OFW as a process. The PKGs and associated RAPs ive downloaded from PSNDL all need han, am i right or is this an exception case? If so, where This might be a stupid question, but I've literally been struggling for half a week now to find a solution to this somewhat simple problem. I've got two kinds of games I want to be able to play on the PS3: regular full game backups in ISO format running off my external NTFS hard drive, and installed PKG games such as Street Fighter III: Third Strike. I can view and lauch ISO games from IRISMAN pretty easily, and the installed PKG games appear ##Welcome to r/PS3Hacks! Before you begin to ask questions, please read this post! New to homebrew?

It allows you to keep the fan control module working even when HEN isn't enabled upon boot, adds HEN compatible CFW tools, hides webMAN till HEN is enabled. And allows you to be able to download any file type from the PS3 browser. I have tried works great for ISO files, videos, themes, plugins, music and more. You can even download a PS3 update file directly to your system without the need of a PS3 or USB drive. You first have to install. Is it possible to get multiman to read and build ISO’s from .pkg games and games I downloaded 
Im on Rebug 4.84.1 CFW, and i can get PSP iso's to run good. But some games have glitches. On ( https://www.psdevwiki.com/ps3/PSP_Emulator_Compatibility_List#T) it says to apply Mini2 Settings to a game. I know how to do that. but psp2ps3 then converts it into pkg? Idk why but PSP pkg dont work on my ps3 for some reason only iso's. The 3rd Birthday has a Fix. And im trying to apply that mini2 fix to the iso itself. Idk, but psp pkg games dont work. Why? Idk. But hopefully there I have downloaded RHEV-H 4.2 https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-virtualization#getstarted (https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-virtualization#getstarted)(RHVirtualization 4.2 Host and Manager iso). I uploaded the image and installed on an HP G9 server baremetal. I found I dont have a WAN/net connectivity later on HPG9 server. How can I still install virt-manager on that machine?? Is it like virt-manager has to be in the same machine HP G9 ? Can virt-manager be installed. 1/29/2019 - Added bgdl proof-of-concept from the FAPS team, Vitagrafix to the "plugins" section, and VHBB to the "apps" section _________________________________________ It is expected that you read this pinned post before posting.

I see a few different methods but they are mostly a few years old. What's the best way to play ps2 games? Use webman? Install pkgs? My ps3 is old and has the software ps2 backwards compatibility. Does that help at all? Thanks. Hello, I'm trying to make my own spin of arch linux. I've been using Archiso and so far it has been a great experience and easy to follow, but I hit an obstacle trying to customize the bootloader on UEFI. I'm trying to skip the default menu that appears by removing the syslinux bootloader altogether and having UEFI just directly boot into arch. My simple attempt of commenting out some of the lines hasn't had any particular success, it just removed arch from the menu. The build.sh (https://git. </p>
