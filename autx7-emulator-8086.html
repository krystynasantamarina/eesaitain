                            <p> I was going through a folder of some of my old code, and I saw this. Thought I'd share here. I grew up on QB and VB6, and although I don't use it much anymore (in favor of C), I feel nostalgic now and then and like to see what kind of weird things I can do with the language. This is a full 8086 PC emulator written in VB6 code. It's not without a few bugs in the CPU (and other parts), but it essentially works. I might go back and fix them in the near future, but I'm sharing as-is for now. Featu. 
Ok, so would it be possible to make something like a raspberry pi zero using only Commodore 64 parts. I've got a microprocessors class and thought it'd be cool to make one of these. Does anyone know of any resources to make an 8086 emu? Is it too complex for someone with minimal experience in low level stuff. The PC version of GEOS has been released under an Apache license. C64 fans and to a lesser extent Apple 2 fans will likely remember GEOS fondly for its capabilities if not its speed. PC/GEOS by was quite fast even on limited hardware. http://www.osnews.com/story/30908/PC_GEOS_source_code_released_under_Apache_2_0_license. Hi guys, I just uploaded the first version of my test floppy / test "ROM" for IBM/PC emulators to GitHub. It only contains one test at the moment but I'm definitely planning to add more as time passes. Since there don't seem to be any other tests for those kind of emulators, I thought this might be something worth sharing. Check it out if you want: GitHub: https://github.com/spycrab/8086-accuracy (https://github.com/spycrab/8086-accuracy) Cheers. Hi! I am a computer engineering student and have been into emulation for the past few months. I have been a long time lurker of this sub and wanted to post my current project. It is certainly not the best but I am proud of it as I have committed a lot of time to it (and needs a lot more time). amp#x200B; Here is the project in question: https://github.com/kovasky/asm8080 (https://github.com/kovasky/asm8080) amp#x200B; Here are some screenshots: https://imgur.com/a/0kyucSK (https://img. I wrote this a few weekends ago, and it's just been sitting around on my hard drive so I thought I'd share. Maybe someone will find it useful. I've tested it with Space Invaders, Microsoft BASIC, and it passes every 8080 CPU test I've run on it. You could use it as the basis of a CP/M emulator, or maybe add the Z80 extensions and make it into a Gameboy emulator. Here's a link to it: https://pastebin.com/sFANRuYr It's easy to use, provide the following functions externally: uint8_t i8080_r. I want to write program for dual head config Retro PC. like showed here: and here: If I'm put correct 2 cards it will work. But hardware is too expensive for me. Anybody knows that PC emulator witch allow me to write and test that kind of software. https://github.com/adriancable/8086tiny This is a neat little emulator that is fully PC compatible, and even includes peripheral support. It is written in C. Credits to /u/adrian_cable. Just wondering, considering we can, nowdays find an MCUs that, within a single ic, contain all the necessities and resources that a 1970s Computer would need to be equipped with dozens of dedicated chip solutions. I know there are some projects where people have used the same/bootleg CPU just like the original, but it just makes me wonder. Yes We can all run a raspberry pi with an emulator but that's just a sissy way out. :P I've seen this projects (https://www.benheck.com/vcsp-rev-51s-start. 
Possibly straddling the cusp where golf meets obfuscation meets tinycode. But it's only obscure in the techniques it uses to make it short, and assuming brevity contributes toward comprehensibility if not readability per se, then an appropriate balance has in fact been achieved; naysayers in comp.lang.c notwithstanding. The BIGENDIAN part probably doesn't # MAME 0.209 (https://www.mamedev.org/?p=468) With another month over, it’s time for another release, and MAME 0.209 is sure to have something to interest everyone. We’ve cracked the encryption on the Fun World CPU blocks, making Fun World Quiz, Joker Card, Mega Card, Power Card, Multi Win, Saloon and Nevada playable.
