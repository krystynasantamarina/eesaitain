                            </header>
                            <p> The Hyperion corporation hires a group of First Order soldiers to attack an area on Pandora to track down former Hyperion man Rhys. The attack happens at Hollow Point with bandits and psychos battling First Order stormtroopers. During the commotion, Rhys hears a voice that says "Traitor!" and sees a Stormtrooper with riot control gear. Rhys grabs his Hyperion Stun baton and battles against the Stormtrooper Conditions: No one can intervene in the duel. Rhys has his Hyperion Stan Baton. After having watched the trailer a few times and heard a few others on YouTube give their analysis I have come up with this theory in the general plot: 1. The “twins” (new bad guys) are either agents of or powerful members of Maliwan 2. The Siren twin is able to steal other powers and transfer them as she wishes - this would explain Maliwans dominance in unique energy weapons and also their seemingly endless supply of this technology 3. The Siren twin will steal Liliths power 
List as many as you'd like, feel free to give explanations for why if you'd like :) For me: - Handsome Jack (Borderlands franchise) - Chloe Fraser (uncharted series) - Nathan/Sam Drake (uncharted) - Peebee (Mass Effect: Andromeda) - Cayde-6 (Destiny franchise) - Trevor philips (GTA 5) May add more later. Edit: - Baird (gears of war franchise) - Rhys (tales from the Borderlands). So we're all fucking wondering who were gonna be able to play as in the upcoming game. I for one am no stranger to speculation! Here are some characters (returning and new) that I'd like to see playable real soon! Fiona (Tales from the Borderlands), The Con Artist: I find this highly possible since they basically have Athena training her to fight and state so often how she'd be a great Vault Hunter. Honestly I'd be more surprised if she wasn't! My only issue is at the end of TFTB (SPOILERS. Rhys with a Handlebar Mustache (https://pbs.twimg.com/media/D2q9JWsWsAAM05a.jpg:large) Vaughn continues to be a Beefcake (https://i.imgur.com/IuaYkrp.png) Involves Leaked Character Art: Loaderbot gt!potentially one of the four playable characters?!lt (https://i.imgur.com/yXWMOLo.jpg). CAST Jaburu Anna Akana Emily (Until Dawn) Frankie Foster (Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends) Katarina (Fire Emblem) Michelle Obama Rainbow Dash (My Little Poney) Sasha (Tales from the Borderlands) Tattletale (Worm) Tambaqui Barry (Pokémon) Chad Johnson Dan Howell Harry Dresden (The Dresden Files) I Like Trains Kid (ASDF movies) Ludacris Quest (World of Quest) Rhys (Tales from the Borderlands) --------------. 
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=wvsd3QIOvU4 There are many but this part is simply genius writing and realky brought the cast together. It was a well earned payoff of badassery. Naturally it has spoilers. Watch Rewind way back to \~2015: at the end of Tales from the Borderlands Rhys and Fiona finally get to open their vault but the game doesn't let us see what's in the vault. Then during the Dev Trailer we see a older Rhys with Zer0 behind him and 3 more bandits/mercenaries surrounding as he shows a hologram of a slightly more broken looking vault symbol. amp#x200B; So I'm asking what does everyone think was in the Vault of the Traveler given the new context? amp#x200B; My personal guess I'm starting to work on a Rhys (Tales From the Borderlands) cosplay, but I have no Idea where to really start for his arm. I have vague ideas of trying to do some resin casts of my arm and forearm to build off of, but I have no idea how to do the elbow and hand in a way that looks relatively coherent. Thank you in advance! For those who don't know, here is a picture, http://cdn.gamerant.com/wp-content/uploads/Tales-from-the-Borderlands-Rhys-and-Fiona-header.jpg. https://i.imgur.com/Cou1YCX.jpg Just something I observed, sorry if this has been posted before. Rhys is an average office drone working aboard Hyperion's top of the line space station Helios. After losing a well earned promotion to his rival Vasquez, Rhys's adventure begins when he gets back at him by attempting to steal a deal for a vault key out from under him, only to discover that it was a fake made by Fiona. This misunderstanding leads him on an adventure across Pandora. Note: Since most of Tales is told by Rhys and Fiona, and they sometimes narrate each other's stories, occasional.
