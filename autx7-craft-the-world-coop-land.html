Don't know if its true. amp#x200B; ## RDR2 Cut Content according to a developer üì∑ amp#x200B; Hi, I worked at Rockstar on RDR2 for a little over 6 years and felt like talking about some of the stuff that was removed from the game for one reason or another. This is going to be a pretty long list and most of it is from memory and will spoil a lot of the story in the final product. You've been warned. Also some of this stuff may contradict other. Hey, y'all! How about an event listing? There‚Äôs another list of all the regular stuff that happens every week, so don‚Äôt forget to check for all your karaokes, trivias, and so on. HAPPENING THIS WEEK: ArtiGras 2019 in Railroad Square. Our annual spring festival, ArtiGras (FREE), is similar to Mardi Gras in New Orleans. It is comprised of food amp crafts vendors, activities, art exhibitions, stage performances preceded by dance lessons, and a 4 pm parade around Railroad Square. 
So I recently binged all I could about Anthem and wrote up all I had learned. Might as well share it with you guys, though I am sure you know most of this! Let me know what you think.

All board game projects meeting those criteria will automatically be included, no need to ask. (But the occasional non-board game project may also sneak in!) Expect new lists each Sunday sometime between 12:00am and 12:00pm It is that time of the month again. My my. Games are starting to pile up. Not that I mind, the main reason behind buying so much is because I'm intent on skipping the next generation. Starting this month, I'm using a new purchase habit: A new game, an old game, and an indie-tier level. Now, Okami does not exactly qualify as Indie, but it fit the money slot perfectly; i had to pass on Dead Cells (physical version is a little tiny weensey overpriced), and Kero Blaster and Freedom Planet weren. ## What this is: This is a weekly, curated listing of Kickstarter tabletop games projects that are either: - newly posted in the past 7 days , or - ending in the next 7 days (starting tomorrow) and have at least a fighting chance of being funded.

When April's gentle rains have pierced the drought Of March right to the root, and bathed each sprout Through every vein with liquid of such power It brings forth the engendering of the flower; When Zephyrus too with his sweet breath has blown 5 Through every field and forest, urging on The tender shoots, and there's a youthful sun, His second half course through the Ram now run, And little birds are making melody And sleep all night. Let's start by reviewing what happened last time (https://www.reddit.com/r/dwarffortress/comments/3s3g9q/blind_play_of_040/). I fired up Dwarf Fortress. I generated a world, complete with a pearl dragon and a plant/river-associated titan made of fire. Everyone wanted the latter to attack my fortress. I noticed a probably-dead civilization called the Glowing Gears and reclaimed one of their old fortresses, named Bindtowns, destroyed by a forgotten beast. I embarked and asked if anyone. G'Day everyone. You're all here because like me, you love the taste of your enemies blood on your sword as you hack them apart in a competitive match. You understand that the taste is so much sweeter because instead of just being handed that sword as you entered the arena, you had to spelunk ravines, brave chasms and survive rabid hordes to scrape the resources together for it. In other words, you love the challenge that ultrahardcore provides. However, when your parents disconnect your internet. </p>
